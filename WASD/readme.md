Soybeans and corn price time-series were chosen to compare performance among different forecasting models

The data source of time-series applied in this experiment were obtained from the World Agricultural Supply and
Demand Estimates (WAOB) from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).

### Overview of time-series used in experimental evaluation:

>The period ranges from January 2014 to February 2020. The attributes represent several time-series features, such as planted area, harvested area, yield, beginning stocks, imports, supply, demand (World), and other estimates from countries with the most significant corn and soybean production

### Attributes and ranges in the supply and demand of corn and soybeans in the period 01/2014 to 02/2020. Most of the attributes are millions bushels:
